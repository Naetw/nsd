Term project proposal templates
===============================

This directory collects templates for the term project proposals.  The project
subject should focus on numerical software, which solves scientific,
engineering, or mathematical problems.  The problems include but are not
limited to:

1. Geometry.
2. Graphics and visualization.
3. Image processing.
4. Optimization.
5. Numerical solution of differential equations.
6. Dynamics.
7. Graph and network.

The proposal templates in this directory are examples for you to define your
term project.  You may choose one of the templates to be the starting point of
your proposal, or use the format to start one from scratch.

The term project is expect to take 40-60 or more hours in total in the duration
of 8-10 weeks.  The proposal templates take that into account, but may or may
not fit into the resource requirement.  Students should make suitable
adjustment when using the templates.

The directory:

* `000_template <000_template/>`__: general proposal template.
* `001_unstmesh_part <001_unstmesh_part>`__: unstructured mesh partitioning
