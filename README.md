**Objectives**: This course discusses the art to build numerical software, i.e.,
computer programs applying numerical methods for solving mathematical or
physical problems.  We will be using the combination of Python and C++ and
related tools (e.g., [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[git](https://git-scm.com), [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), etc.)
to learn the modern development processes.  By completing this course, students
will acquire the fundamental skills for developing modern numerical software.

**Prerequisites**: This is a graduate or senior level course open to students
who have taken engineering mathematics or equivalence.  Working knowledge of
Linux and Unix-like is required.  Prior knowledge to numerical methods is
recommended.  The instructor uses English in the lectures and discussions.
